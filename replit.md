## Previous Changes (July 24, 2025)

✓ **Implemented Exact User-Specified Pricing Formula**: Frame pricing correctly accounts for mat size impact - 16x20 artwork with 2" mat becomes 20x24 frame (88" perimeter ÷ 12 = 7.33 feet × price per foot × sliding scale markup)

✓ **Fixed Mat Size Impact on Frame/Glass**: Frame and glass sizes now correctly adjust when mat is added - 16x20 artwork becomes 20x24 frame/glass with 2" mat border
✓ **Added Searchable Frame and Mat Dropdowns**: Enhanced order form with searchable comboboxes for frame styles and mat colors, making it easy to find specific options from large inventories

**Note**: Authentication is required for all data operations. Users must be logged in via Replit Auth to create customers, orders, or invoices.
